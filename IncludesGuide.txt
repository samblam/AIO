When creating a new php file anywhere (include or other), you MUST include/require files in this order:

File                       | Command       | Comment
---------------------------|---------------|---------------------
includes/session.php       | require_once  | all files
./secure.php               | require_once  | if user-facing file
includes/globalSecure.php  | require_once  | all files
All others                 |               |
