\opening{Dear \Student{} (\Banner):}
\begin{center}
\large \bf Re: Allegation of Academic Offence – (\Student)
\end{center}

Please be advised that Professor \Professor, Faculty of Computer
Science, alleges that you have committed an academic offence contrary
to the academic regulations of Dalhousie University. In particular,
it is alleged that you have \Allegation{} with respect to \Work{} for
\Class{}.

I enclose a copy of the Professor's allegations and supporting
documentation.

I ask you to meet with me and the Professor at the following time
and location to discuss this matter:

\begin{center}
\bf\large
Date: \MeetDate\\
Time: \MeetTime\\
Location: \MeetLocation
\end{center}

If you do not attend this meeting, your case will be referred to
the Senate Discipline Committee for a hearing.

\ignore{ % Set to noignore during exams or holidays
The meeting can be rescheduled, at your written request, [e.g. to
accommodate your exam schedule] to a date immediately following
your return to Dalhousie University. The request must be received
no later than (one working day before initially scheduled meeting).
}

Please bring all documentation and information that you think is
necessary to respond to the allegation to the meeting or submit it
in advance to me. You may also bring a friend, relative, representative
from the {\em Dalhousie Student Advocacy Service} (DSAS), or a
lawyer to assist you. Should you choose to use the services of DSAS,
you should contact them as soon as possible before the meeting at
494-2205 or {\tt dsas@dal.ca}. Dalhousie Counseling Services are
also available to you at 494-2081.

You are to confirm with me no later than \ConfirmDate{} your attendance
at this meeting, and the names of any individuals who will be
accompanying you and the role of those individuals (i.e. advocate,
support person).

Within five working days of the meeting, I will make a preliminary
assessment as to whether you have committed an academic offence,
and if so, what penalty is warranted in the circumstances (an
exception for students who have a prior offence on record is noted
at the end of this paragraph). You will then have two working days
to determine whether you will accept my assessment and recommended
penalty. If you accept these, the matter will be presented for
ratification and implementation. If you reject my assessment and/or
recommended penalty, or if the matter is so serious that it warrants
suspension, dismissal or failure of your academic year, your case
will be referred to the Senate Discipline Committee for a hearing.
When there is a common allegation, which is a case involving 2 or
more students facing allegations arising from the same fact situation,
and a student has a prior academic offence on record, I will make
a preliminary assessment only as to whether or not an academic
offence has been committed; the issue of penalty will be determined
by the Senate Discipline Committee.

\noignore{ % Please use the following paragraph ONLY when a final grade has 
           % not yet been entered on the student’s transcript.
The Registrar will record a grade of PENDING for the class on your
transcript, until receiving confirmation of the result of the
allegation and the final mark.
}

Please take note that if you request an official transcript to be
issued while your case is pending, a revised transcript will be
sent to all earlier recipients upon the conclusion of your case.

This allegation does not affect your current status in the class.
Requirements of attending classes and labs, completing assignments,
and writing exams remain in effect.

The allegation will proceed even if you choose to withdraw from the
class, your academic program, or the University. If the allegation
of an academic offence is proven, this finding will be recorded on
the Senate database of disciplinary cases.

If you have any questions concerning this process, please contact
me at 494-\AIOPhoneExt{} or \AIOEmail.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
