\large \bf Re: Allegation of Academic Offence â€“ (\Student)
\end{center}

I have reviewed the allegation and considered all evidence put
forward during our discussion and have found that you have \Allegation{}
on \Work{} in the course \Class. 

\AllegationDiscussion{}
% I urge you to consider the discussion that we had on using resources
% online such that you may feel confident that you will never be in
% a similar situation in the future.

I recommend that you:
\Penalties{}

Please take note that your name will be recorded on a database that
keeps track of previous offenses. This consequence is automatic and
doesn't leave a trail on your student record. A subsequent allegation
would, however, be handled directly by the Senate Disciplinary
Committee.

I'm sorry that we met under these circumstances. However, I encourage
you to carry on with your studies and put this behind you.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
