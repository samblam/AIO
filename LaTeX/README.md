This directory contains all of our projects relevant LaTeX files.

Here's the idea:

1. We run the python script.
2. The python script sets all the required information in its own .tex file (this file is the only thing that changes case to case)
3. We run the necessary .tex file to generate the form.
4. That's all actually.
